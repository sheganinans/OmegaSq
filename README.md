OmegaSq stands for [omega squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number).

OmegaSq is a visual toy in which 3 trefoil knots have additive rotational vectors applied in a sequential self-dependent fasion, creating a pleasing animation that is possibly non-repeating, but more likely finite and very large.

To put another way, the rotational distance of the current joint is calculated by taking the previous joints rotational distance and adding a constant, creating a highly complex emergent animation.

Written in Clojurescript, use "lein run" to give it a try.
